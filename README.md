CHAI is a library that handles automatic data migration to different memory
spaces behind an array-style interface. It was designed to work with
[RAJA](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA) and integrates with it. CHAI could be
used with other C++ abstractions, as well.

CHAI uses CMake and BLT to handle builds. Make sure that you have a modern
compiler loaded and the configuration is as simple as:

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/cuda ../

CMake will provide output about which compiler is being used, and what version
of CUDA was detected. Once CMake has completed, CHAI can be built with Make:

    $ make

For more advanced configuration you can use standard CMake variables.

More information is available in the [CHAI documentation](https://chai.readthedocs.io/en/develop/).
