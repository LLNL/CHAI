Configuring CHAI
================

In addition to the normal options provided by CMake, CHAI uses some additional
configuration arguments to control optional features and behavior. Each
argument is a boolean option, and  can be turned on or off:

    -DENABLE_CUDA=Off

Here is a summary of the configuration options, their default value, and meaning:

      ===========================  ======== ===============================================================================
      Variable                     Default  Meaning
      ===========================  ======== ===============================================================================
      ENABLE_CUDA                  On       Enable CUDA support
      ENABLE_UM                    Off      Enable support for CUDA Unified Memory.
      ENABLE_CNEM                  Off      Enable cnmem for GPU allocations
      ENABLE_IMPLICIT_CONVERSIONS  On       Enable implicit conversions between ManagedArray and raw pointers
      DISABLE_RM                   Off      Disable the ArrayManager and make ManagedArray a thin wrapper around a pointer.
      ENABLE_TESTING               On       Build test executables
      ENABLE_BENCHMARKS            On       Build benchmark programs
      ===========================  ======== ===============================================================================

These arguments are explained in more detail below:

* ENABLE_CUDA
  This option enables support for GPUs. If CHAI is built without CUDA support,
  then only the ``CPU`` execution space is available for use.

* ENABLE_UM
  This option enables support for Unified Memory as an optional execution
  space. When a ``ManagedArray`` is allocated in the ``UM`` space, CHAI will
  not manually copy data. Data movement in this case is handled by the CUDA
  driver and runtime.

* ENABLE_CNEM
  This option enables the use of the cnmem library for GPU allocations. The
  cnmem library provides a pool mechanism to reduce the overhead of allocating
  memory on the GPU.

  When ``ENABLE_CNMEM`` is set to ``On``, you must tell CMake where to find
  the cnmem library. This can be done by setting the ``cnem_DIR`` variable, for
  example:

  .. code_block:: bash

    -Dcnmem_DIR=/path/to/cnmem/install

* ENABLE_IMPLICIT_CONVERSIONS
  This option will allow implicit casting between an object of type
  ``ManagedArray<T>`` and the correpsonding raw pointer type ``T*``. This
  option is disabled by default, and should be used with caution.

* DISABLE_RM
  This option will remove all usage of the ``ArrayManager`` class and let the
  ``ManagedArray`` objects function as thin wrappers around a raw pointer. This
  option can be used with CPU-only allocations, or with CUDA Unified Memory.

* ENABLE_TESTING
  This option controls whether or not test executables will be built.

* ENABLE_BENCHMARKS
  This option will build the benchmark programs used to test ``ManagedArray``
  performance.
