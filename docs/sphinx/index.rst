CHAI is a C++ libary providing an array object that can be used transparently
in multiple memory spaces. Data is automatically migrated based on
copy-construction, allowing for correct data access regardless of location.
CHAI can be used standalone, but is best when paired with the RAJA library,
which has built-in CHAI integration that takes care of everything.

- If you want to get and install CHAI, take a look at our getting started
  guide. 
- If you are looking for documentation about a particular CHAI function, see
  the code documentation.
- Want to contribute? Take a look at our developer and contribution guides.
